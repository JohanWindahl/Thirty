**Details:** A dice game similiar to Yatzee, with 6 dices. The game consists of 10 gamerounds with 3 throws each. 
The gamerounds are: Below 3 and Multipel of {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}. In Below 3 all dices that has a value of 3 or lower is counted. In Multipel of x, the best combination of dices that is equal to x is counted. Score is calculated by the number of total dots on the dices included in the best permutation. For example the set [1,2,2,3,4,5] for gameround Multiple of 4 gives: [1,3] + [2,2] + [4] = 12. For gameround Multiple of 4 the best score yielding dice set would be [4,4,4,4,4,4] which would give 4*6=24.

Automatic score handling was implemented.
